              Recently, the radar chart has become a popular way to visualize player statistics in soccer. This popularity is in large part thanks to Ted Knutson and his website <a href= "http://statsbomb.com/">StatsBomb</a>. Ted regularly churns out radar charts for players across Europe's top 5 leagues. For example: 
              <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Leo Messi, Barcelona 10-11. So many green numbers, still just 23. He really isn&#39;t human. 5.86 successful drib90! <a href="http://t.co/VaU5yqgNg8">pic.twitter.com/VaU5yqgNg8</a></p>&mdash; Ted Knutson (@mixedknuts) <a href="https://twitter.com/mixedknuts/status/532844837599727616">November 13, 2014</a></blockquote>
              Part of the appeal of these charts is that players can be compared using overlays to see where their stats match up and where they differ. You can even overlay a player's previous seasons to see how the his skills or role might have changed over time. While I think these charts offer a lot of insight, I think the radar chart is a bit wanting as a method of conveying information. Comparing overlays in the same category is easy enough, but trying to eyeball differences across categories which are not adjacent on the chart can be tough. A similar method for displaying multi-dimensional data is <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_coordinates">parallel coordinates</a>. A parallel coordinates graphic treats the different dimensions of the data as individual axes, and maps each data point to its corresponding position on that axis. One benefit of viewing multi-dimensional data this way is that the number of dimensions is not nearly as limited as in a radar chart or alternative visualization method. For n-dimensional data, a larger n quckly becomes an issue for a radar chart. Parallel coordinates charts are able to handle a larger number of dimensions. Using data from <a href = "http://objective-football.blogspot.com/">Objective Football</a>, I built a graphic which visualizes multi-dimensional player data from the 2013-2014 Premier League season across 178 players from every team. Included are midfielders and forwards who played over 900 minutes. Apart from Age, Minutes, and Shot Percentage, every category is a rate statistic, meaning the number is per 90 minutes played. For stat definitions see Objective Football.
